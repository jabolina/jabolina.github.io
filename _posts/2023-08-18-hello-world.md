Hello, everyone!

This is just a presentation post to say hello and what's the goal with blogging.

This is my very first post.
Will someone ever read this stuff? Likely not.
But I still can jot down some things occasionally and keep a record of everything technical I've been working on.

Whenever the urge strikes, it will be about the broad theme of distributed systems.
I'll try to keep it to verification of algorithms, primitives for group communication, or an implementation of something.
I also want to get more familiar with storage systems.
So I have some room to share thoughts and how I am learning.

See you all in the next post(?).
