Hello! I am a computer scientist interested in distributed systems, specifically in the algorithms and implementation for solving agreement problems, the design, verification, and all the challenges to maintain correctness.
I like to work at the intersection of the distributed systems with storage systems.

I work as a software engineer at [Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en) on the core development of [Infinispan](https://infinispan.org/), an in-memory distributed data grid.
I am also a developer for [jgroups-raft](https://github.com/belaban/jgroups-raft), an implementation of the raft algorithm on top of [JGroups](https://github.com/belaban/JGroups).

Previous to that, I worked for smaller companies here in Brazil. On the academic side, I got my master's and bachelor's degree in the [Computer Science Faculty](https://www.facom.ufu.br/)
at the [Federal University of Uberlandia](https://ufu.br/) under the supervision of Prof. [Lasaro Camargos](https://lasarojc.github.io/).
My research focused on the verification of multicast algorithms, available [here](https://repositorio.ufu.br/handle/123456789/36421).
